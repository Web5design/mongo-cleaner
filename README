Suppose you have two collections: users and pajamas

users collection contains the following document:
{'_id': 'foo@bar.com'}

pajamas collection contains the following document:
{'_id': ObjectID('5028...'), 'user': 'foo@bar.com', 'color': 'pink'}

Suppose you delete the user's document and forgot to delete his pajama. Now the pajama document is stale and takes up space on your database.

This tool find and removes stale documents.

To istall:

pip install mongo-cleaner

Sample usage:

import pymongo
from mongo_cleaner import Cleaner

structure = {
    'pajamas': [('user', 'users')],
}

connection = pymongo.Connection()
db = connection['pajamaapp']

cleaner = Cleaner(structure, db)
cleaner.clean()

To see which documents are stale without removing them pass 'dry_run=True' to clean().
